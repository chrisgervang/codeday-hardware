Welcome CodeDayers!
===================

This is your guide for understanding all the hardware we have provided for you.
We have over 100 packages of hardware at this CodeDay as part of a trial Chris is doing.

Chris's wish is that every hacker is at least proficient at building hardware hacks. The kits provided are for a wide variety of experience levels, so take some time and hack around!

If you have ANY questions - make a Github "Issue" here: https://github.com/chrisgervang/codeday-hardware/issues.
The staff will be notified immediatly!

Table of da content:
====================
Borrowing guidelines (TL;DR: Please return everything borrowed by the end of CodeDay!)

Borrowing guidelines:
---------------------
- Everything you check out **must** returned at the end of the event.
  - **One exception**: **you may keep a Spark Core*** if you use it in your hack, or can tell a staff member what you learned from it during the event.
- Have an ID ready! We will ask to hold onto it until all of your borrowed items are returned.
- You may check-out/check-in stuff at any point. Just look for Michelle. She's got you covered.


Just to reiterate: **You get a free Spark Core*** if you use it in your hack or tell us what you learned while playing with it. Just tell one of the staff what you did with your Spark Core, and they will clear you off the list! **Please return everything else.**

Pebble _(4)_
------

The developer friendly smart watch that everyone loves! (and no I wasnt paid to say that..). These watches are super easy to program with their new JavaScript developer environment. Although the watch connects to our phones via Bluetooth, you can easily make apps that connect to the internet.

####Getting Started:

####Dev Tools:


SmartThings
-----------

Build fantastic smart home elements into your hack! The SmartThings platform interfaces with so many things (hundreds of things). We have a nice selection of their popular products as well as A TOTALLY HACKABLE SMARTTHINGS ARDUINO SHIELD!

**There will be a workshop on setting up the SmartThings developer environment and creating _Smart Things_ that can be controlled from anything on the internet.** We wont leave you hanging!

###Hub _(4)_

Plugs into ethernet. You'll need this for any SmartThings hack as it connects all the _things_ together.

###MultiSense _(4)_

Temperature, Vibration, 3-Axis Accelerometer, and Magnetic Door Sensor all in one tiny package!!!

###Presence _(2)_

Tiny key chain article that can detect if you are around your SmartThings hub. This is an on/off sensor (doesn't know exactly how close you are to the hub - just that you are within 500ft).

###Motion _(2)_

PIR Motion Sensor - great for detecting humans, pets, and such. (Note: Not good at detecting spiders!)

###Switch _(4)_

Bring a lamp (or anything you want to plug in) to use this! This is a smart plug that can be turned on and off remotely.

###Moisture _(1)_

I dont expect any floods at CodeDay... but you'll be the first to sense it with this one! Maybe it will detect soda dam breaches - watch out!

###Arduino Shield _(4)_

This one is my favorite because you basically send Strings back and forth between SmartThings and your Arduino, and you can program text to trigger/do anything you'd like!



Arduino Compatible Microcontrollers
------------------

###Spark Core _(9)_

The easiest way to get a hardware hack connected to the internet! The Spark community has put together a plethora of tools including an in-browser IDE, all the libraries, and it is fully Arduino compatible. Includes: Spark Core, USB Cable, Breadboard.

**You can probably keep the Spark Core! Read Borrowing Guidelines for details.**

###Arduino Uno Kit _(2)_

The easiest way to make a battery powered hardware hack! We've got the Uno, the USB cable, and the battery pack + battery.

###DigiSpark _(3)_

The easiest way to make a teeny tiny hardware hack! These little arduinos are fun to mess around with. Includes: Digispark dev board

###Intel Galileo _(1)_

The easiest way to make a hardware hack with Intel InsideTM. Nuff said. I believe this is an arduino + ethernet shield + other Intel magic. Includes: Galileo board + USB cable + Power Piggy.


Getting Started With Circuits Kits
-----------------

###LightUp Mini Kit _(1)_

###Circuit Scribe Kit 1 _(1)_

###Circuit Scribe Kit 2 _(1)_

Leap Motion _(1)_
-----------------

Great way to integrate complex hand/finger movement into a hack. No hardware knowledge required - just play with their awesome SDKs (including a JavaScript SDK!)

Electric Imp _(1)_
------------

Kinda like Arduino, but written in Squirrel language. It awesomely WiFi connected, and pretty easy to get started with!

Tessel _(1)_
------------

JavaScript hackers rejoice!! This nifty piece of silicon has all the features of Arduino, but you can program the entire thing with JavaScript and NPM Packages.


NFC Ring _(1)_
--------

This is a ring the has two NFC chips in it. It can be programmed to store information via a phone, and then other NFC phones can read what is on it! Use it as a discreet ID badge. Includes: NFC Ring + tiny manuel.

Note: I dont have any *working* NFC shields for arduino, so I cant really help with this one. You're welcome to try my NFC shields though (Ask Chris for them)

Belkin WeMo
-----------

Yet another WiFi connected Smart Home Product! I've been able to use NPM packages to control these on the local network. They are very smart or good, but they get the job done without a hub.

###Switch _(1)_

On/Off Switch

###Motion _(1)_

Motion/No Motion Sensor

Raspberry Pi
------------

The $35 computer for all the Linux fans in the bright blue earth. Gotta love em'

###Model B Kit _(2)_

Includes: Raspberry Pi, USB Cable, and SD card (with fresh Raspian Debian freshly installed!!!!)

###Camera Kit _(1)_

Video/Photo camera widely supported by the raspberry pi. Includes: Camera Module + cable

Shields: Arduino/Breadboard Compatible
-------------------------------------

###GPS Shield _(2)_

###MOSFET Shield _(1)_

###Relay Shield _(2)_

###RGB LED Shield _(1)_

Sensor/Actuator Kits
--------------------

###Grove Kit 1 _(1)_

###Grove Kit 2 _(1)_

###Grove Kit 3 _(1)_

###Magnetic Switch _(2)_

###Sensor Pack _(4)_

###Servo Kit _(3)_


Misc Kits
---------

###Breadboard + Wires _(6)_

###3 Digit LED Keypad _(1)_

###Digital Number Pad _(1)_

###12V Warm LED Strip _(1)_

###RGB LED STRIP KIT _(1)_





*While supplies last. One per hacker please!
