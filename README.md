Welcome CodeDayers!
===================

This is your guide for understanding all the hardware we have provided for you.
We have over 100 packages of hardware at this CodeDay as part of a trial Chris is doing.

Chris's wish is that every hacker is at least proficient at building hardware hacks. The kits provided are for a wide variety of experience levels, so take some time and hack around!

**Ask questions as Github "Issues" here: https://github.com/chrisgervang/codeday-hardware/issues.**
The staff will be notified immediatly!

Borrowing guidelines:
---------------------
- Everything you check out **must** returned at the end of the event.
  - **One exception**: **you may keep a Spark Core*** if you use it in your hack, or can tell a staff member what you learned from it during the event.
- Have an ID ready! We will ask to hold onto it until all of your borrowed items are returned.
- You may check-out/check-in stuff at any point. Just look for Michelle. She's got you covered.


Just to reiterate: **You get a free Spark Core*** if you use it in your hack or tell us what you learned while playing with it. Just tell one of the staff what you did with your Spark Core, and they will clear you off the list! **Please return everything else.**

Pebble _(4)_
------

The developer friendly smart watch that everyone loves! (and no I wasnt paid to say that..). These watches are super easy to program with their new JavaScript developer environment. Although the watch connects to your phone via Bluetooth, you can easily make apps that connect to the internet.

####Getting Started:

####Dev Tools:


SmartThings
-----------

Build fantastic smart home elements into your hack! The SmartThings platform interfaces with so many things (hundreds of things). We have a nice selection of their popular products as well as A TOTALLY HACKABLE SMARTTHINGS ARDUINO SHIELD!

**There will be a workshop on setting up the SmartThings developer environment and creating _Smart Things_ that can be controlled from anything on the internet.** We wont leave you hanging!

###Hub _(4)_

Plugs into ethernet. You'll need this for any SmartThings hack as it connects all the _things_ together.

###MultiSense _(4)_

Temperature, Vibration, 3-Axis Accelerometer, and Magnetic Door Sensor all in one tiny package!!!

###Presence _(2)_

Tiny key chain article that can detect if you are around your SmartThings hub. This is an on/off sensor (doesn't know exactly how close you are to the hub - just that you are within 500ft).

###Motion _(2)_

PIR Motion Sensor - great for detecting humans, pets, and such. (Note: Not good at detecting spiders!)

###Switch _(4)_

Bring a lamp (or anything you want to plug in) to use this! This is a smart plug that can be turned on and off remotely.

###Moisture _(1)_

I dont expect any floods at CodeDay... but you'll be the first to sense it with this one! Maybe it will detect soda dam breaches - watch out!

###Arduino Shield _(4)_

This one is my favorite because you basically send Strings back and forth between SmartThings and your Arduino, and you can program text to trigger/do anything you'd like!



Arduino Compatible Microcontrollers
------------------

###Spark Core _(9)_

The easiest way to get a hardware hack connected to the internet! The Spark community has put together a plethora of tools including an in-browser IDE, all the libraries, and it is fully Arduino compatible. Includes: Spark Core, USB Cable, Breadboard.

**You can probably keep the Spark Core! Read Borrowing Guidelines for details.**

###Arduino Uno Kit _(2)_

The easiest way to make a battery powered hardware hack! We've got the Uno, the USB cable, and the battery pack + battery.

###DigiSpark _(3)_

The easiest way to make a teeny tiny hardware hack! These little arduinos are fun to mess around with. Includes: Digispark dev board

###Intel Galileo _(1)_

The easiest way to make a hardware hack with Intel InsideTM. Nuff said. I believe this is an arduino + ethernet shield + other Intel magic. Includes: Galileo board + USB cable + Power Piggy.


Getting Started With Circuits Kits
-----------------

Never touched electronic circuits before, but curious what all the hu-bub is about?? Than you should pick any of these up and play away!

###LightUp Mini Kit _(1)_

Lego-like building blocks for tons of basic circuits. Includes cool phone app for visual troubleshooting!

###Circuit Scribe Kit 1 _(1)_

Draw your own circuits! Literally! Just use their silver pen and some paper + this kits components to make something cool.
Includes: Pen + Paper + a handful of basic electronic components + battery.

###Circuit Scribe Kit 2 _(1)_

Draw your own circuits! Literally! Includes: Pen + paper + LED test + battery.

Leap Motion _(1)_
-----------------

Great way to integrate complex hand/finger movement into a hack. No hardware knowledge required - just play with their awesome SDKs (including a JavaScript SDK!)

Electric Imp _(1)_
------------

Kinda like Arduino, but written in Squirrel language. It awesomely WiFi connected, and pretty easy to get started with!

Tessel _(1)_
------------

JavaScript hackers rejoice!! This nifty piece of silicon has all the features of Arduino, but you can program the entire thing with JavaScript and NPM Packages.


NFC Ring _(1)_
--------

This is a ring the has two NFC chips in it. It can be programmed to store information via a phone, and then other NFC phones can read what is on it! Use it as a discreet ID badge. Includes: NFC Ring + tiny manuel.

Note: I dont have any *working* NFC shields for arduino, so I cant really help with this one. You're welcome to try my NFC shields though (Ask Chris for them)

Belkin WeMo
-----------

Yet another WiFi connected Smart Home Product! I've been able to use NPM packages to control these on the local network. They are very smart or good, but they get the job done without a hub.

###Switch _(1)_

On/Off Switch

###Motion _(1)_

Motion/No Motion Sensor

Raspberry Pi
------------

The $35 computer for all the Linux fans in the bright blue earth. Gotta love em'

###Model B Kit _(2)_

Includes: Raspberry Pi, USB Cable, and SD card (with fresh Raspian Debian freshly installed!!!!)

###Camera Kit _(1)_

Video/Photo camera widely supported by the raspberry pi. Includes: Camera Module + cable

Shields: Arduino/Breadboard Compatible
-------------------------------------

###GPS Shield _(2)_

Tracks location! Yay!

###MOSFET Shield _(1)_

Faster switcher than relay. Can be used to control brightness of LED Strips via PWM.
Includes: Shield + Funky Wire

###Relay Shield _(2)_

Arduino controlled On/Off switch for higher voltage circuits (like lamps, or sockets).
Includes: Shield + Funky Wires

###RGB LED Shield _(1)_

Simple yet fun RGB LED put on a tiny shield.

Sensor/Actuator Kits
--------------------

_Grove_: Sounds fancy! Hmm, it kinda is - but is basically just a standard cable package for a bunch of sensors. It makes it so you dont have to do as much work before you get coding!

###Grove Kit 1 _(1)_

This is a glorified sensor pack.
Includes:
- Microphone (audio sensor)
- Piezo Speaker
- 2 Grove wires
- Breadboard Grove Shield


###Grove Kit 2 _(1)_

This is another glorified sensor pack.
Includes:
- LCD w/ RGB LED backlight
- Touch sensor
- 2 Grove wires
- Breadboard Grove Shield

###Grove Kit 3 _(1)_

This is yet another glorified sensor pack.
Includes:
- Temperature Sensor
- Rotation Sensor (similar to a potentiomitor)
- Button
- LED (includes a dial for brightness?)
- Relay
- Light Sensor
- Servo
- Bunch-O-Wire
- Arduino Grove Shield

###Magnetic Switch _(2)_

This simple switch is on or off depending on whether the magnet is touching. Commonly used to keep burglers from poking around ones house.

###Sensor Pack _(4)_

This isn't a glorified sensor pack. Just a normal one.
Includes:
- Photoresistor
- Piezo speaker
- Tilt sensor
- Pressure pad sensor

###Servo Kit _(3)_
Tiny servo. I dont believe it is continous (so it only rotates within a certain range)
Includes:
- Servo
- Spec panel
- Plastic mounts


Misc Kits
---------

###Breadboard + Wires _(6)_

The very basics!!! Just a breadboard and 10 breadboard wires I had laying around.

###3 Digit LED Keypad _(1)_

This can display 3 numbers w/ a floating point.

###Digital Number Pad _(1)_

Basic telephone keypad packaged nicely for Arduino projects.

###12V Warm LED Strip _(1)_

Basic kit includes:
- Long strip of LEDs (please dont cut)
- Power supply (prestripped for hacking convenience)

Note: To control brightness you'll want the MOSFET shield too!

###RGB LED STRIP KIT _(1)_

This one is a bit messy, but is basically a few RGB LED strips plus a couple premade breadbaord circuits for controlling the RGB LEDs. Great for adding color light!

Includes:
- 2 breadboards with complete MOSFET control circuits for each color channel
- Power supply

Please try to return the breadboards with the control circuit working.

*While supplies last. One per hacker please!
